# aws-sdk-typescript

## Intro

Not really. Instead, it generates the typings necessary for the AWS SDK for JavaScript from the JSON Files.

If you're curious about the quality, look under output/ folder.

Use the bundled aws-sdk.js, and augment with the services you want to support. In theory, it should work :)
